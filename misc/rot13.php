/**
 * rot13
 * /rot ther'teen/ [Usenet: from "rotate alphabet 13 places"], v. The simple 
 * Caesar-cypher encryption that replaces each English letter with the one 13
 * places forward or back along the alphabet, so that "The butler did it!" 
 * becomes "Gur ohgyre qvq vg!" Most Usenet news reading and posting programs 
 * include a rot13 feature. It is used to enclose the text in a sealed wrapper
 * that the reader must choose to open - e.g. for posting things that might 
 * offend some readers, or spoilers. A major advantage of rot13 over rot(N) for
 * other N is that it is self-inverse, so the same code can be used for 
 * encoding and decoding. 
 *
 * UPDATE: I've just found out that this algorithm is already implemented natively in
 * PHP with the function str_rot13
